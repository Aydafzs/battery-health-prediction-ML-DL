Comparative analysis of ML and LSTM models for lithium-ion battery voltage prediction using NASA dataset.
This repository contains code and results for a research project focused on predicting lithium-ion battery voltage behavior using machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM) models.
The dataset is derived from NASAâ€™s Accelerated Life Testing (ALT) of Li-ion batteries.
Results show that LSTM achieved the lowest RMSE, indicating strong temporal pattern learning.
This work is part of my research on sustainable energy systems and intelligent material diagnostics.
